Application to use computer vision algorithms of **NOOS** (face detection, emotion, age, gender). 
It will look for faces and for the biggest one, the emotion, age and gender will be shown.

It is using a NodeJS with a simple web interface using JQuery.

This application was used in the _Innovate UK_ event in 2017. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itKD7PrtiEU) you'll see how the application works.

npm install
```

## Run

First run the following command in your terminal (in _Noos_Web_APP_ folder):

Then go to your browser and write `localhost:3000`. A pop up windows will show up asking for camera permissions. After allowing it, the application will be running.
